# Functions and Variables

## Functions
A function is a set of instructions that we can call with a name. This set of instructions is reusable.

```python
print()
```

```python
def say_hello()
```
## Variables
A **variable** is a virtual box in which we put data.

```python
age = 43
```

**In Python, a variable is typed.** This means a variable (or the 'virtual box') does
not only contain the value, but also the type of the variable.


Here are some variable types:

- **Integers or whole numbers**: a number without decimales.
- **Floats or numbers with decimales** : for example : 1.5
- **Strings** : Characters between inverted commas - `"Hello, World!"`.
- **Lists** : that we will see very soon :).

There are several other types, but we these will suffice for now.
