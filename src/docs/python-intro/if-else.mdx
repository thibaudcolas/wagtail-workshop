# If statements

This is one of the most important concepts of programming (Bill Gates talks about it all the time).

Often in programming, the instructions we give to the computer dependent on certain actions or values.

For example:

`If` someone is under 18, the can't vote. `Else` they can vote.

```python
if age < 18 :
	print("You can't vote")
else:
	print("You can vote")
```

The code above is called an **if statement**.

We can also add supplementary conditions to if statements - `elif`. 
An `elif` is just like an `if`, it just has a different condition.

Let's take the example from before:

```python
if age < 18 :
	print("You can vote.")
elif age == 18:
	print("Congratulations! You can vote")
else:
	print("You've been voting.")
```


`if` and `elif` must have conditions after them. The computer checks if the value of the condition is `True` in order to decide what to do. If the condition is `True`, the code below the `if` or `elif` is executed. 

If the condition is `False` the code below the `else` is executed. 

To show equality in Python, we use two `=`, because one `=` is used for variable declaration.
