# The console and the file


When coding in Python, there are two areas we can code in: the console and the file.

## The file

Most of the time, we code in the file. 

- When we 'run' the file, we run all of the lines from top to bottom.
- The output is only visible with a `print()` statement
- We use files for code that we will run several times.

## The console

The console shows the output of your progeam (the code in the file).
You can also code directly into the console!

The console:

- Runs each time onve it is written (after you press `Enter`)
- Shows the output of each lines
- Is interactive and used for exploration


### Maths

We can some some simple calculations directly in the console:

- `2 + 3`
- `2 - 4` 

In programming, the division sign is `/` and the multiplication sign is `*`. So:

- 2 `*` 4 = 8
- 10 `/` 2 = 5
