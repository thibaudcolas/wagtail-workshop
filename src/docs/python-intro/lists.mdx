# Lists

**Lists** in Python are variables in which we can put several variables.

We can declare them empty or with variables insdie them:

```python
names = []
colours = ['red', 'yellow', 'blue']
post_codes = [75001, 75002, 75003]
person = [3, 'Bob']
```

A list is also a variable. Once declared, we can use it in the rest of the program.

```python
print(post_codes)
```

To access elements in a list, we can ask to see the index of the value we are looking for.

The first element of a list has index 0. In programming, we start counting from 0 and not from 1. If we are looking for the third element we will look for the element at index 2.

```python
colours = ['red', 'yellow', 'blue']
colours[0]
colours[2]
```
