# Modules


A module allows you to logically organize your Python code. Grouping related code into a module makes the code easier to understand and use. A module is a Python object with arbitrarily named attributes that you can bind and reference.

Simply, a module is a file consisting of Python code. A module can define functions, classes and variables. A module can also include runnable code.

There are several pre-programmed modules in Python to help with common tasks. These modules make the [Standard Library](https://docs.python.org/2/library/index.html).

### Import a module

To use functions from a module in your programme, you need to import it into your file.

To do that, use the command "import"Â :

```python
import os

import codecs
```


### List of standard modules

The most important modules in the Standard Library are:

- [cgi](https://docs.python.org/3/library/cgi.html)
- [math](https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html)
- [os](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html)
- [pickle](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html)
- [random](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html)
