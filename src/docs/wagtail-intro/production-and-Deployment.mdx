# Session 3 - Production and Deployment

There are a few things we need to do to get our site production ready, and also some specifics for deploying it to heroku. First off, make sure you have a heroku account.

Then we'll need to tnstall the Heroku CLI, [https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli) We'll use this for creating the heroku site and some settings changes.

We are going to be using a different database driver (Postgres) for heroku. Install PostgreSql like so:

```bash
pip install psycopg2
pip install dj_database_url
```

As our Heroku app will be accessible to the rest of the web, we'll want to use our production settings rather than our local settings. Our local settings have `Debug=True` set, and utilise Django's built in static file serving mechanism which is not secure.

First of all, we'll add the following settings into our production.py settings file. These new settings firstly allow us to take advantage of Heroku's PostgreSQL plugin. The ALLOWED_HOSTS setting is necessary to allow Heroku to run our app at the auto-generated domain that it will create.

Open up mysite/settings/production.py and change it to look like this:

```python title=mysite/settings/base.py
import os
import dj_database_url
from .base import *


env = os.environ.copy()

SECRET_KEY = env['SECRET_KEY']
DATABASES['default'] =  dj_database_url.config()

# Honor the 'X-Forwarded-Proto' header for request.is_secure()
SECURE_PROXY_SSL_HEADER = ('HTTP_X_FORWARDED_PROTO', 'https')

# Allow all host headers
ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['*']
DEBUG = False

try:
   from .local import *
except ImportError:
   pass
```

Next, install the various requirements that Heroku looks for when hosting a Wagtail/Django application. These all come together in a pip package called `django-toolbelt`. We'll install this, and then use the `pip freeze` command to update our requirements.txt file.

```bash
pip install django-toolbelt
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

The pip freeze command should have updated your `requirements.txt` file if successful

**Create a procfile.** Heroku requires you to create a file called Procfile, in which you declare the commands to be run by your application's Dynos. Your Procfile should be located in the root directory of your app, the same directory in which your `manage.py` file is located. In this case you only need one line in this file:

```Procfile title=./Procfile
web: gunicorn mysite.wsgi --log-file -
```

Git commit and push these files up to your repo.

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Heroku configuration"
git push origin master
```

We will use the heroku cli to create our heroku app. We will pull our code from github into the heroku app. You may be asked to login when first using the heroku cli, it's the same acount details as your web account you set up.

```bash
heroku create codersofcolour  # Replace with your name
git push heroku master # Pushes your committed code up to the heroku remote
```

If you ran `heroku create` from your project root, you should find you have a new git remote added (heroku), if not you'll have to add it manually.

After running this you should see a lot of noise in your terminal whilst heroku does it's thing.

After this is done, heroku should have built your site. In the project on the heoku UI you should see something like this:

![](./pd_1.png)

> Note that heroku attached a database for us, you can see it's also added the environment variable for the database under the settings tab by clicking 'reveal config vars'.

![](./pd_2.png)

If you click **Open app** now, you'll probably see an error page

![](./pd_3.png)

This is throwing an error because we haven't ran `python manage.py migrate` on heroku to populate the database. Also remember we specified DEBUG=False in our production settings file? Well we shouldn't be seeing this ugly error screen at all, it's for developers. This is because we haven't told heroku to use our production settings file. Let's fix it.

In heroku go to the settings tab and hit reveal config vars. Add 2 new values:

Key: DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE

Value: mysite.settings.production (replace with your site name)

Key: SECRET_KEY

value: 'somereallylongstring'

If you open your site again on heroku from the open app button you should see a more gentle error screen. This confirms the production settings are used.

Next, setup the database. Back In your local terminal, from your project root run the following.

```bash
heroku run python manage.py migrate
heroku run python manage.py createsuperuser
heroku ps:scale web=1  # Ensures that a new Dyno is running for your project
```

The above is running similar shell commands we did locally, but using the heroku CLI we can run them on our heroku container.

Your site should now be live on heroku, check by opening the app again from with heroku.

You might have noticed that none of your css styling is applied though... we need to make a few more adjustments for this using a package called [Whitenoise](http://whitenoise.evans.io/en/latest/)

Whitenoise is a Python library that allows Django to serve its own static files without relying on a CDN like Amazon S3. First of all, let's install the package and add it to our requirements.txt file. Locally switch back to your terminal and project root.

```bash
pip install whitenoise
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

Now you need to add Whitenoise to your MIDDLEWARE. Open `settings/base.py` and add whitenoise. Note This MUST go after ...SecurityMiddleware

```python title=mysite/settings/base.py
MIDDLEWARE = [
    ...
    'django.middleware.security.SecurityMiddleware',
    'whitenoise.middleware.WhiteNoiseMiddleware',
    ...
]
```

Now let's change our static file storage type, and some compression settings. Open settings/production.py and add this:

```python lineNumbers=true title=mysite/settings/production.py
STATICFILES_STORAGE = 'whitenoise.storage.CompressedManifestStaticFilesStorage'
COMPRESS_OFFLINE = True
COMPRESS_CSS_FILTERS = [
    'compressor.filters.css_default.CssAbsoluteFilter',
    'compressor.filters.cssmin.CSSMinFilter',
]
COMPRESS_CSS_HASHING_METHOD = 'content'
```

To sync updates, we use git. So lets add our changes to a new git commit.

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Added Whitenoise"
```

Before we push this up to the heroku remote like we did before, let's configure github to automatically pull in deployments when we push to master. Go to the deploy tab in heroku and configure github by searching for our repo:

![](./pd_4.gif)

Then click the button below to enable deployments automatically when the master branch changes in github.

> We won't have a CI so there is potential to add migration files that may cause damage. This may happen when migration files conflict. Usually the heroku build will fail if this happens.
>
> Migration conflicts is a large topic when working with CMS frameworks like django. There are some things Django can do to help deal with this, one comman practice is to use "merge migrations" when you have some migration files that have been generated with the same id in the same app, E.G 006_change_field, and 006_update_text_field. Django can't apply both of these to the database as it tracks by the migration file id (006_) so it knows what has and hasn't been applied.

> You can use manual deployments if you prefer though (button a bit lower down to pull the code in from github.

If you sucessfully connected github, just push to the github origin (not heroku), and the app should build.

```bash
git push origin master
```

You may notice the app not loading on heroku here, if that's the case add gunicorn to you requirements.txt file and push it to github

```bash
gunicorn==19.9.0
```

You should now see your styling coming through. E.G [https://codersofcolour.herokuapp.com/](https://codersofcolour.herokuapp.com/)
